# EDA for Text Classification

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part of Lab 1 for the course *DM2583 Big Data in Media Technology*.  

The EDA includes:
- Dataset overview (size, structure, missing values).  
- Distribution of target variable (balanced positive/negative classes).  
- Review length statistics and distribution.  
- Word frequency analysis (highlighting stopwords, HTML artifacts, mentions, hashtags).  
- Comparison of vocabulary in positive vs. negative reviews.  
- Identification of noise and proposed preprocessing steps.  
- Reflection on challenges and how EDA informs later preprocessing and modeling.  

Results from this analysis guide the upcoming **data cleaning, feature extraction, and model development** steps.
